# Home-Based Smart NMES Device

A collaborative project with Barrow Neurological Institute to deliver a game-driven, home-based NeuroMuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) system. By combining real-time computer vision, adaptive stimulation control, and interactive games, our platform makes rehabilitation engaging, safe, and effective.

## Overview
The Smart NMES platform integrates:  
- A commercial NMES stimulator (manual max intensity safeguard)  
- An Arduino Nanoâ€“based PCB (MOSFETs, potentiometer/digital potentiometer)  
- A Bluetooth (or USB) serial link  
- A USB camera for computer vision  
- A Python application using OpenCV, MediaPipe & Pygame  

It guides users through therapeutic exercises via three games, automatically increasing stimulation when motion stalls and resetting upon full range completion.

## Hardware Architecture
1. **NMES Stimulator** (commercial)  
   - Preâ€‘set to a safe maximum manual intensity.  
2. **Arduino Nano & Custom PCB**  
   - Drives MOSFETs and potentiometer (or digital pot).  
   - Receives `u`/`j` commands to increase/decrease intensity.  
3. **Bluetooth Module**  
   - Serial data link between PC and Arduino.  
4. **USB Webcam**  
   - Captures live video for motion tracking.

## Software Architecture
- **app.py (Python 3.x)**  
  - **OpenCV**: Frame capture and preprocessing.  
  - **MediaPipe**: Pose and hand landmark detection.  
  - **Pygame**: Game rendering and UI.  
  - **PySerial**: Serial communication with Arduino.  

**Flow:**  
1. **Init**: Load libraries, open serial port, initialize models.  
2. **Loop**:  
   - Grab frame â†’ detect landmarks â†’ compute angles.  
   - Evaluate against target range and timing.  
   - Decide to send `'u'` (up) or `'j'` (down) commands.  
   - Render visuals & intensity gauge.  
3. **Exit**: Close camera, serial port, and windows.

## Working Principles

### Motion Tracking Pipeline
1. **Landmark Detection**  
   - **MediaPipe Pose** for arm flexion/extension.  
   - **MediaPipe Hands** for finger flexion/extension.  
2. **Angle Computation**  
   - Calculate joint angles in degrees (elbow or PIP/DIP joints).  
3. **Stuck & Full-Range Detection**  
   - Detect minimal angle change over a set interval (e.g., 3s).  
   - Lock out stimulation on downward movement until reset.  

### NMES Control Logic
- **Intensity Levels**: 0% â†’ 100% in 10% increments.  
- **Increase**: If motion stalls below target range for >3s or moves against gravity.  
- **Hold**: Maintain current intensity until user resumes motion.  
- **Reset**: Upon reaching full flexion/extension (100% range).

## Interactive Game Modes

### 1. Range of Motion Game
Guide the user through full arm flexion and extension cycles. Stalled motion triggers gradual intensity rampâ€‘up.

### 2. Ping Pong Game
Deflect a green paddle to hit a ball; a predictive blue marker shows the target. Missing slows the ball and increases stimulation until correct position is reached.

### 3. Balloon Filling Game
Perform finger flexion/extension to inflate a virtual balloon. If inflation stops, NMES intensity increases until motion resumes.
